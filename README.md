The goal of this assignment is to learn the design and implementation of some common GUI component at professional quality in terms of design, correctness, dealing with user errors, field validation and robustness to attacks, cross browser and platform compatibility and usability. Students will also practice (optionally) automated GUI testing.

We were given 2 weeks to implement and deploy to a server for testing. 

The assignment consists of 2 pages, the Form page and the Results page. The form page takes in user data and checks for validation, the results page displays that data with a map of the address entered. 

I used Node.js for the backend with bootstrap, CSS, and HTML in both pages, and EJS used to template the Results page.
Google API's were used for reCaptcha v2, Geolocation, and Google Maps. Bootstrap Validation was boolstered with additional regex pattern testing.
